# Azure & AWS

## AWS 

### 🌩️ What is Cloud Computing?
````
Instead of buying your own big computer (servers, storage, network), you rent them from a company (like AWS) using the internet.
You pay only for what you use (like electricity, water).

Earlier companies used to buy their own infrastructure like servers, storage, and networking. But instead of building and maintaining all this, now we can use AWS cloud services. In AWS we only pay for what we use, like electricity or water bill.

#### 🌟 Advantages of AWS
```
1.COST SAVING:-
  In AWS we do not need to buy costly hardware
  we pay only for what we use

2.SCALABILITY & FLEXIBILITY:-
  If work load increases, we can aquickly add more storage or servers.
  If workload decreases, we can reduce resources

3.High Availability & Reliability:-
  AWS has multiple regions and availability zones.
  Even if one datacenter fails, our application can run from another.

4.Global Reach:
  AWS has datacenters all over the world.
  We can host applications closer to users (low latency).

5.Security:-
AWS follows high-level security standards.
Features like IAM (Identity & Access Management) help us control access.

6.Managed Services:-
We don’t have to manage everything.
Example: AWS RDS manages database backups, patching, and updates automatically.

7.Innovation & Variety:-
AWS provides 200+ services (AI, Machine Learning, IoT, Big Data).
We can choose the right tool as per requirement.

```
🏗️ Services of AWS
```
AWS provides
1.Infracture as a service,
2.Platform as a Service,
3.Swaftware as a service.


🔵 0. On-Premises () :- 
👉 Company owns everything – from hardware to applications.
We Manage all (100% Responsibility)

1.Networking (switches, routers, firewalls)
2.Storage (disks, SAN/NAS)
3.Servers (physical machines)
4.Virtualization (VMware, Hyper-V)
5.OS (Windows/Linux installation & patching)
6.Middleware (web servers, app servers)
7.Runtime (Java, .NET, Python environments)
8.Data (databases, files)
9.Applications (ERP, CRM, websites, etc.)
10.Security (firewalls, access control, backups, DR)

🟢 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
👉 AWS provides raw infrastructure (compute, storage, networking, virtualization, physical security).
👉 We install and manage OS, DB, and applications.
We Manage:- OS,Middleware,Runtime,Data,Applications
AWS Manages:- Networking,Storage,Servers (hardware), Virtualization, Security (infrastructure-level)

AWS IaaS Services:-
⚡ Compute
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud – virtual servers)
EC2 Auto Scaling (automatic scaling of servers)
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) (distribute traffic)
💾 Storage
EBS (Elastic Block Storage – hard disks for EC2)
EFS (Elastic File System – shared storage)
S3 (object storage)
Glacier / S3 Glacier (long-term backup)
Storage Gateway (hybrid storage between AWS & on-prem)
🌐 Networking
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Elastic IPs
Direct Connect
VPN
Transit Gateway
🔒 Security & Access
IAM (Identity & Access Management)
KMS (Key Management Service)
CloudHSM
Shield, WAF
📊 Monitoring
CloudWatch (monitoring infra)
CloudTrail (logs and auditing)


🟡 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
👉 AWS provides infrastructure + platform (OS, middleware, runtime).
👉 We only focus on data & applications.
We Manage:-Data,Applications
AWS Manages:-Networking,Storage,Servers,Virtualization,OS,Middleware,Runtime,Security

AWS PaaS Services:-
⚡ Databases (Managed DBs)
RDS (Relational Database Service: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
Aurora (AWS proprietary DB)
DynamoDB (NoSQL DB)
ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached cache service)
⚡ Application Services
Elastic Beanstalk (easy app deployment)
Lambda (serverless code execution)
API Gateway (API management)
⚡ Analytics / Integration
Kinesis (real-time streaming data)
Glue (ETL service)
EMR (Hadoop/Spark clusters, managed)

🔴 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
👉 AWS (or vendor) provides full application ready to use.
👉 You don’t manage anything, just use the software.
You Manage:- Nothing (only use application)
AWS Manages:- Everything (Networking → Application)

AWS SaaS Services:-
WorkMail (managed email service)
Chime (video conferencing, collaboration)
QuickSight (Business Intelligence dashboards)
Connect (cloud contact center / call center solution)
Cognito (partially SaaS) (user authentication, login for apps)
Many Marketplace SaaS apps (3rd party on AWS Marketplace)
